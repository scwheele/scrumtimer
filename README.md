# scrumtimer

Created a small web app to help with timing my team's standup meetings.

You can change the amount of time by editing the "time" variable in assets/main.js

```
var time = 120;
```

App background will slowly count down, as well as large numbers on the screen.

When the timer hits 0, background will flash red and orange.

This app is meant to run on any device, it's simplistic and ready to use out of the box.

Here is a github pages version: https://scwheele.github.io/scrumtimer/
