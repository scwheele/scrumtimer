# scrumtimer

Created a small web app to help with timing my team's standup meetings.

You can change the amount of time by editing the "time" variable in assets/main.js

```
var time = 120;
```

App background will slowly count down, as well as large numbers on the screen.

When the timer hits 0, background will flash red and orange.
